The above drive link consists datasets of patients with similar scars/rashes which we had sorted into cancerous(malignant) and non cancerous (beign). We trained the model using these sorted datasets which made ourn model recongize the scars and tell if the scars uploaded by client is canceorous or not with 70-75%accuracy.
