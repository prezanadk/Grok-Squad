# Grok-Squad

This repository no longer stores the HAM10000 image data or trained models.

- Place raw HAM10000 assets under `ham10000_raw/` and processed splits under `data/`.
- Keep large binaries (images, checkpoints, .h5 files) out of Git; they are ignored by `.gitignore`.
- If you need to share datasets or weights, use an external bucket or Git LFS instead of regular Git.
